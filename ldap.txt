LDAP

concepts:

* DIT - Directory information tree
tree structure of directory like 

Acme 
     - People
            + John
	    + Jane
            + Ben
            + Burt
              …..

     - Groups
            - sales
                   + Member - Burt
                   + Member - Ben
            + admin


* RootDSE is the top level - Acme in this case
  On levels below there may be organisational levels (ou) or entrys.

* Entry

  Every entry (e.g. person ‘class’ or object) has a unique DN and one or more objectClasses

* DN (distinguished name)

  Unique identifier for a entry or organisational unit.

* objectClass

  Packaging of a bunch of attributes

* attribute
  
  Example: ‘cn’ = ‘common name’, ‘sn’ = surname’, ‘o’ = organization

* schema

  Packaging files where attribute and object classes are contained.

  schema example for rootDSE Acme:

      1. dn: dc=example,dc=com,dc=au
 
      1.1 dn: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,dc=au
      1.2 dn: ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com,dc=au


* dc
     Domain component, a search path component, see example below
     think of a component of a path

* ou
     Orgainzational unit

* CN 
     Common name. - think of an object instance at leaf level

("CN=Dev-India,OU=Distribution Groups,DC=gp,DC=gl,DC=google,DC=com");

From the com Domain Component, find the google Domain Component, and then inside it the gl Domain Component and then inside it the gp Domain Component.
In the gp Domain Component, find the Organizational Unit called Distribution Groups and then find the the object that has a common name of Dev-India.
